# Bookstore

### Directions

I have a bookstore. My bookstore has 6 shelves and 4 tables. My shelves and tables can each hold 6 books. I also have 'the back' where I put all the books I don't have on display.
Fork this repo and create an app that achieves the following tasks

- I want to be able to add/remove books from my bookstore
- I want to be able to add/remove books from my shelves, tables, or 'the back'
- I want to be able to move a book between my shelves, tables, or 'the back'
- I want to be able to search for a book and be shown where I put it.
- I want to be able to look at a table, a shelf, or 'the back' and see what books are in it
